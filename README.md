# Robert Price Builders' Merchants

The construction industry has never been busier with growth year on year. Material suppliers and merchants have also advanced their strategies to cater to a greater market with online stores. UK national businesses have, perhaps, had an advantage as product availability and a greater number of store locations made such delieries more feasible. However as smaller and more local companies develope their strategies, it may be possible to compete with the larger companies with savvy techniques to overcome the disadvantages initially preventing an online presence.

Robert price Builders' Merchant is a real company and have given permission to use their name, logo and images for this demonstration. Robert Price Bilders' Merchants have recently commissioned a new website and are in the process of populating it with current images and information. They are hoping the new website will go live in the near future, however without an e-commerce aspect as the complications present a substantial hurdle.

I will plan, code and implement a website for an e-commerce store for Robert Price Builders' Merchants. The website will be linked to a database containing all of the products, the categories and users associated with it. A user must be able to view and buy products, while a superuser will be able to create, edit and delete items within the database. The additional functionality of adding, updating and deleting categories will also be considered but may be out of the scope for this project due to time constraints.

- The "games" collection is linked to the "categories" collection through the category names. A game can fall under one or more categories.  -->


### Yet to be Implemented

Sizes
It would have been desirable to have certain items in various sizes, lengths or thicknesses. The code has been designed to accomodate for items with various sizes, however it was not possible to adjust the product price inline with the size. For this reason all products have been set with no size. If however cetain products come in a variety of sizes with no price difference, then this feature is ready to implement, pending a change in size values as required.

Login:
- The option of a social media link/login feature would ease the signing up process and have greater potential for data gathering.

Profile Page:
- A possible link to social media.

Delete functionality:
- A final check on whether the admin would like to delete the product would be a necessity with implementation, as these buttons may be clicked by mistake, potentially losing important information.

Product Rating:
- Preventing the user from upvoting multiple times will be essential to make the system fair and representative.
<!-- - Limiting the value to 5 (a rating as a fraction of 5) -->

Delivery:
- In a real setting delivery may not be possible for certain products and/or to certain areas.
- A postcode check would be required before the delivery cost is calculated and granted, for items over a certain weight/size. Smaller items may be posted and would follow the system demonstrated on this website.

## Testing

1. W3C testing for the code.
- The HTML was going to be validated by copying and then pasting the source code into the validator. The validator rturned a lot of problems but most were repeated issues. The first 9 results can be see in the image below: 

index.html
![Attempted Validation](static/images/html-val.png)

- The first error states that the section lacks a header. This is referring to the flash messages. 
- The second error states that a p element can not be the child of a span element. This is being rendered in the with data from the database, however a longer term fix will be sought.
- The third type of error states that there is a duplicate ID. This is due to many game images being rendered on each game card and a way around this is unknown.


2. CSS testing
- W3C CSS (Jigsaw) Validator was going to be used to test for errors. The successful test result is shown in the following image:

style.css
![CSS Validation](static/images/html-val.png)

3. Lighthouse (Dev Tools)
A report was conducted for a mobile device, and returned the following scores:
- Performance - 80%
- Accessibility - 96%
- Best Practices - 93%
- SEO - 92%

There are many things that could be optimised, such as properly sizing images. All advisories will be considered and acted upon if necessary.

4. User Stories
- The first user story is addressed as the website provides a list of games and categorises them to make page navigation easier and so a better level of UX is achieved.
- The second user story is addressed as the website provides a method of submitting new games.
- The final user story is considered with the ability for admins to control website content; the ability to edit and delete games along with the ability to create, update and delete the categories.

## Bugs

- The table layout on the shopping bag page becomes illegible on screens smaller than large. The responsiveness would need adjusting to ensure all items are displayed correctly and clearly.
- The images were taken directly from the old website. After multiple attempts to resize the images to fit, it was realised that certain images are cropped (presumably to fit the old website). In a real deployment, most images would require new and professional images provided by suppliers or the marketing team.

## Deployment

## Acknowledgements
To build this website, I followed the tutorial and mini Boutique Ado project again and feel that it shows a close resemblance to the project. Further iteration and a greater effort will be made to create a more visually unique website. For this project it was felt the Python, Jinja, Stripe and database usage was of greater importance to show my understanding of the content of this module.

A special thanks must go to Robert Price Builders' Merchants for allowing me to use their data, product images and logos, along with their branding style. The existing website was used as inspiration of style and fuction in order to develope an e-commerce aspect to their website.

The many tutors, users and other students on slack who are always willing to assist in solving any issue presented.

Finally I'd like to acknowledge the help provided by my tutor Brian who has assisted and guided me through the Web Development Course.
